## UI and Styling

### Design System and Theming Guidelines

- Define design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.) in a **single source of truth** file under `src/styles/theme.ts`.

- Avoid scattering color or spacing values across multiple files; centralize them in the theme file.

- Only import values from the theme file or Tailwind config inside components.

- Maintain consistent usage of color, radius, shadow, fontSize, etc., by referencing theme values.

- Keep Tailwind customizations (if needed) inside `tailwind.config.js` only; do not replicate them in JS/TS files.

- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns.

- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and `useWindowDimensions`.

- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS.

- Support dark mode with `useColorScheme`.

- Ensure accessibility using ARIA roles and native props.

- Use `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler` for animations and gestures.

**NativeWind Integration**

- Lock NativeWind to a tested version; maintain compatibility with Expo SDK in `compatibility.json`.

- Use a script to validate NativeWind setup (`tailwind.config.js`, `babel.config.js`, and `app.json`) after install.

- Add a `postinstall` hook to run `expo doctor` and verify proper setup.

- Include a clean-up script (`expo start --clear`) to fix potential Metro bundler cache issues.

- Avoid using bleeding-edge versions of NativeWind or React Native unless verified.

**Rive Integration**

- Use `rive-react-native` for animations; ensure compatibility with the current Expo SDK.

- Use `.riv` files exported from Rive and store them in a dedicated `assets/rive` directory.

- Wrap Rive animations in reusable components and expose props for dynamic control (e.g., play, pause, state machine input).

- Avoid re-rendering entire Rive views unnecessarily; use `useRef` and `useEffect` for precise control.

- Validate Rive version compatibility on every upgrade and clear Metro cache when integration issues arise.
